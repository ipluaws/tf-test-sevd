This Single Page Application (SPA) is developed in React and is deployed using Amazon S3 and CloudFront. Whenever a change is committed to the code repository, the pipeline triggers a build process. This build process constructs the application and then synchronizes the latest version of the application with the S3 bucket for deployment.
We have used some repository secrets to execute the github actions pipeline, such as AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_REGION. These values has to be added accordingly before executing the pipeline.
